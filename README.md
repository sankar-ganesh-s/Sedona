# Sedona Insurance Web Application

## Objective:
          The Insurance Policy Dashboard Application was built to deliver a dynamic, user-friendly platform for tracking and managing insurance policies in real-time. With features like horizontal scrolling, live search, and advanced filtering, users can quickly access policy data based on specific actions such as endorsement, cancellation, or reinstatement. The dashboard also visualizes filtered results—like showing only endorsements or cancellations—in intuitive charts, supporting data-driven decisions and improving operational clarity across insurance workflows.
